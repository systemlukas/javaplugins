// Note on Electron context:
// The 'ssh2' library is a Node.js module. Using it directly in the Electron renderer process
// (where React code runs) can be problematic if nodeIntegration is false (which is the default
// and recommended setting for security).
// If 'ssh2' relies on Node.js APIs not available in the renderer's sandboxed environment,
// or if direct network connections from the renderer are restricted, this service will not work
// as intended.
// The typical solution is to move this SSH logic to the Electron main process and use
// IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to call it from the renderer.
// For this subtask, the implementation is done as requested, but this is a critical point
// for a real Electron application. This code will likely fail or cause errors if run
// directly in a sandboxed renderer without Node.js integration.
// For example, `new Client()` or `conn.connect()` might fail because they expect a full Node.js environment.
// Specifically, `ssh2` uses Node's `net` and `crypto` modules extensively.
// While some polyfills might exist, complex libraries like `ssh2` usually require a true Node.js runtime.
// The `Buffer.from(params.privateKey)` also assumes Node.js `Buffer`.
// Final verdict: This code is highly unlikely to work in the renderer process as is. It should be in the main process.Okay, the `sshService.ts` file has been created with the `connect` function and the necessary event handlers. I've also included a note about the Electron context and the likelihood that this code will need to be moved to the main process.

The `privateKey` is handled by converting it to a Buffer if provided, as expected by `ssh2`.

The subtask specifies that a basic usage example in `App.tsx` is optional. Given the high probability that `ssh2` won't work directly in the renderer process, creating a UI example now might be premature. The core logic for the service is implemented as requested.

I will now submit the report for this part of the task.
